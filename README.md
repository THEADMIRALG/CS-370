The purpose of this project was to code an intelligent agent thats purpose is to find the best possible path through a maze. This code utilizes a deep-Q algorithm in order to accomplish this. 


Computer scientist's jobs are to find solutions in software in the most efficient way possible while also doing so in an ethical way. This is important because efficiency within software can save companies and users time and money. When creating this appication I needed to determine how to program the machine to solve the maze in the least amount of epochs possible. This is where the efficiancy aspect comes in since I don't want the program running longer than it needs to in order to complete the maze. 

When designing a program that saves data I need to consider the ethical responsibilities if there are external users involved. Users need to knwo exactly what is being recorded and how it is being used for the application. The should also be aware that their data is not being sold or used in future applications for the comapny and is secure in our database.
